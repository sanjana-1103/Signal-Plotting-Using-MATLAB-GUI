# Signal-Plotting-Using-MATLAB-GUI
Signal plotting using MATLAB GUI enables interactive visualization of signals through user-friendly controls like buttons, sliders, and menus. 
I have plotted 4 types of Signals that include Sine Signal, Square Signal, Triangular Signal, Composite Signal Using MATLAB GUI.

1.sine signal:sin function from matlab
2.square signal:square fuction
3.Triangular signal:sawtooth function
4.Composit signal:addition of sine,square and triangular signal

I have used MATLAB2016a to get the Results.
